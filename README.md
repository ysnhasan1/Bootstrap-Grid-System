# Bootstrap-Grid-System

Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.

## About The Project

* In this project, I wanted to show that Bootstrap is very simple but effective.
It is very helpful when creating Responsive Websites.
It contains 12 columns in a row.
If we do not want to use all 12 column individually, we can group the columns together to create wider columns.

* Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size that you have.
On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in four columns, but on a small screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top of each other.

## Available Breakpoints

* Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints for building responsively.
